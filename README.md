## React Color App - 
Created with `create-react-app`, all with ***class component*** :sparkles: .

---
You can seea :point_right: [Live demo](https://react-color-app.vercel.app/) here.

My first large app from the course [The Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) by *Colt Steele*.
An app for you create and customize your own color palletes, with some forms validations (like the name of your color, name of your pallete) and 
sync with your local storage :smiley_cat: .



#### Some Libs that i use in this project:

* `react-transition-group`
* `react-sortable-hoc`
* `rc-slider`
* `react-router-dom`
* `chroma-js`
* `emoji-mart`

*Was a very fun and exciting app for me, i hope you enjoy :wink: .*
